- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Uelsuam3 filling out a git template here.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in many things such as pomo (postmodernism) 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always learning ... trying to learn a little swift, Python... in order to have a career change...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... with difficulty, I'm too busy at the moment (unemployed and because of that my main mailbox that I read feels bombed.)
