 ðŸ‘‹ Hi, <br>
 <br>Iâ€™m @Uelsuam3 (Ñ¤) :virgo: :goat: :family: <br>
I may Multiple Sclerosis :wheelchair: but I'm OK.
<br>With family in the UK :uk:, France :fr: and the Philippines :philippines:, we always have a lot of travelling to do.:airplane: :mountain_railway: :earth_asia: 
<br>ðŸ‘€ Many interests such as pomo (postmodernism), ï£¿, ... <br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning several languages: Swift, Python... or whatever comes my way in order to do what I'm trying to do or to have a career change...
<br>I want to be creative while still searching for more freedom and independance (work at anytime from anywhere as long as I can get the work done).
<br>Emacs is currently my favorite editor, probably due in part to the admiration I have towards Linux and FreeSoftware communities.
<br>ðŸ“« How to reach me ... with difficulty. (the main mailbox that I consult feels constantly bombarded.)
